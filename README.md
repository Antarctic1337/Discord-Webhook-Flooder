# Discord Webhook Message Script

This Python script allows users to send a message through a Discord webhook. It uses the `requests` library to send HTTP requests to the webhook URL. Additionally, we utilize the `colorama` package to change colors in the console and make the user interaction more appealing.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can install the `requests` library and `colorama` package using the following commands:

`pip install requests`

`pip install colorama`


## Usage

1. Download the script from [GitHub](https://github.com/Antarctic1337/Discord-Webhook-Flooder) or copy the source code and save it in a file named `discord_webhook_sender.py`.

2. Open a console or terminal and navigate to the location of the `main.py` file.

3. Run the script by typing the following command:

`python main.py`

or

`py main.py`


4. The script will prompt you to enter the target webhook URL, the message, and the message count.

5. Enter the webhook URL, the message, and the number of messages as shown in the console.

6. The script will now send the messages through the Discord webhook, and the progress will be displayed in the console.
